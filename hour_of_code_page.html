<div class="content"><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 6th of November we held an Hour of Code event at the Secondary School №236. That was an interesting and exciting experience for us. We started working upon the Hour of Code project long before the day of presentation. In order to coordinate our event successfully, we got together with our group members and started to disseminate the responsibilities among group members and discuss the tactics, which we can use in order to encourage students. For example, Matanat Heydarli had to get permission from the school to hold our event. Safiyar Safiyarli should get certificates for our participants. Raul Rahimli was responsible for the PowerPoint presentation which we used during the Hour of Code. Agil Aliyev should have come to the class earlier, open the site ‘code.org’ on the computers, and set the language to Azerbaijani for students to understand it. Then we planned our event in this sequence:<br><br>
        1. Matanat talks about the ADA university<br><br>
        2. Raul Rahimli gives information about the Hour of Code<br><br>
        3. Safiyar Safiyarli gives awareness about what the algorithms are<br><br>
        4. Agil Aliyev explained to the students what is code.org and how to work in code.org<br><br>
        5. We helped the students to work on the code.org extra questions<br><br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teachers and the students greeted us very warmly. They sat on the chairs, and we started our presentation. Firstly, Matanat gave information about ADA University. She was talking about the history of ADA University, its number of students, the foreigners studying there, and the achievements of the students.<br><br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After our presentation we gave the permission for students to start working with code.org by themselves. Some children were having some difficulties with it, and we tried to help them individually. However, the students were good at making the progress, understanding and doing the tasks and it was probably because they had held the similar Hour of Code before which helped both the instructors and the students. They have used the Hour of Code's bee's version where they try to get the nectar and reach the goals. Moreover, they finished before the time was up and started to help their peers. It revealed that these students have experienced the same course over the course of their program, which is "algoritmika.az".<br><br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For our preparation we decided to have an outline of our work and the division of the work for each group member. We decided that Metanet is going to talk about ADA University, when and by whom the university was founded. She also gave information about how many students are studying at ADA university, and how many of them are foreigners to show the students that ADA is a successful university that is known in the foreign countries. Lastly, she showed some of the achievements from the ADA students and passed the presentation to Raul. Raul started giving information about "Hour of Code '', he mentioned what this event is for, and what are we going to do in this class. He mentioned what can be the benefits of this event. Then Safiyar started to talk about what an algorithm is, how it is used in our lives and how it can make our jobs easier by applying algorithms to computers. Lastly Agil showed what is code.org, how we are going to work there, and he also showed some examples that students are going to work on.<br><br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The event was very great, we also enjoyed and had fun with the students. The students were listening to us very carefully and enjoyed our presentation. They were passionate about learning and writing the code in code.org. platform. They expressed their impressions about writing the code like "It is very easy, it looks like a real-life algorithm, even if we can do it, everyone can do it". In addition to this, they asked if they could work on code.org after this event with their own account. Some of the students created their own account after the event was done. The positive side of the project was that the students were very clever and were aware of the programming. Moreover, we know that they are going to develop their skills and become better in this field. The other good side was that the school had the computer classroom, and there was a projector and lots of computers, which were in a good condition. After our presentation they thanked us for coming and holding an entertaining class and giving a great opportunity to be familiar with the great code.org platform.<br><br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We did not encounter any problem about the event itself. We had difficulty finding a society to present our project. We asked the 7 schools to get permission for running our event; however, they rejected us or demanded any legal document from the university. Finally, we requested the school in which we organized our event with the help of our friend. Fortunately, this school agreed to allow us to run our Hour of Code event and present our work and contribute knowledge about coding to the students.<br><br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Firstly, we would like to thank the director of the school for giving permission to hold our event. In addition to this, we are thankful for the informatics teacher, who helped us to coordinate our event. Moreover, we would like to convey our thankful expression to Rasta Guluzada, who helped us to interact with the director of the school.<br><br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To sum up, the Hour of Code event was a successful collaboration of entertainment and instruction. In addition to participants' exploration of the complexities of coding and algorithms, they also learned about the offerings of ADA university. Students practiced their newly acquired skills by successfully finishing the “Minecraft" segment on code.org. Students were encouraged to learn more about the exciting field of programming by the additional motivation of earning a certification of participation, which gave them a sense of success. Overall, it was both entertaining for instructors and students. The program emphasized the significance of making learning exciting and pleasurable with its activities and real results.  We hope that it was an enormous success that had a long-lasting effect on the kids' academic paths.<br><br>
